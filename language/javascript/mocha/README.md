## Try Mocha

- [https://mochajs.org/](https://mochajs.org/)

### assertions

> Mocha allows you to use any assertion library you wish. In the above example, we’re using Node.js’ built-in assert module–but generally, if it throws an Error, it will work! This means you can use libraries such as:

> should.js - BDD style shown throughout these docs
> expect.js - expect() style assertions
> chai - expect(), assert() and should-style assertions
> better-assert - C-style self-documenting assert()
> unexpected - “the extensible BDD assertion toolkit”
